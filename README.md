#JINNAX: Physics-informed Neural Networks simulation with JAX

Python package `jinnax` provides functions to generate synthetic data and easily train
Physics-informed Neural Networks in `JAX`. It has the modules `data` and `nn` for data generation
and neural network training.

Its documentation can be found [here](https://raw.githack.com/dmarcondes/JINNAX/master/docs/jinnax.html)  

A tutorial of `jinnax` is available at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dmarcondes/JINNAX/blob/master/Tutorial_PINN_simulation_with_JINNAX.ipynb) where more details about its data generating and training functions can be found.
